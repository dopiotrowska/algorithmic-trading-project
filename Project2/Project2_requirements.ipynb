    "## Project: Combining Signals in Financial Markets with Real-World Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "- Develop multiple trading signals that, when combined, outperform the markets across various environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Signal Development and Market Assumptions**\n",
    "- Develop multiple signals (e.g., indicators, price patterns, moving averages, sentiment data) and combine them using methods such as:\n",
    "  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\n",
    "  - Random Forest\n",
    "  - Other machine learning techniques (Lectures 1, 2, 4).\n",
    "- Alternatively, take a completely different approach:\n",
    "  - Identify a statistical market feature and exploit it (simplicity is key).\n",
    "- Minimize the difference between out of sample and in sample performance of your strategy\n",
    "- Use **BackTrader** for backtesting (Lecture 3)\n",
    "- Simulate real-world trading conditions:\n",
    "  - **Slippage:** 0.2%.\n",
    "  - **Commission:** 0.4%.\n",
    "- Implement risk management techniques such as:\n",
    "  - Stop-loss.\n",
    "  - Take-profit.\n",
    "  - Trailing stop (justify the choice of these mechanisms).\n",
    "- Short selling is allowed (for simplicity -> no liquidity constraints)\n",
    "- Assume the markets behave similarly to stock market (no margin account, margin calls - for simplicity)\n",
    "- Trading rules:\n",
    "  - Open a maximum of **10 positions at once**.\n",
    "  - Allocate **10% of capital per position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Testing**\n",
    "- Test the signals across different timeframes.\n",
    "- Measure performance using the following metrics:\n",
    "  - **Return Rate.**\n",
    "  - **Maximum Drawdown.**\n",
    "  - **Sharpe Ratio (rate =0.03).**\n",
    "- **Important Deadline:**  \n",
    "  - By **27th January**, five different time series (1,000 ohlc price entries each) will be uploaded. (1h, 4h, 1d, 1m timespans of the data)\n",
    "  - Datasets are going to be random (with strong trend, week trend, horizontal move, down trend, very volatile etc) \n",
    "  - Test your best strategy on these datasets.\n",
    "  - Provide tabularized results for them in a form\n",
    "    - timeseries1, return in %, max dd, sharp ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Performance Evaluation**\n",
    "- Grades will be awarded based on:\n",
    "  - Strategy performance.\n",
    "  - Justification for the effectiveness of the strategy.\n",
    "- Results will be compared using:\n",
    "  - **Sharpe Ratio.**\n",
    "- Additional metrics to consider:\n",
    "  - **Maximum Drawdown.**\n",
    "  - **Win Rate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Implementation**\n",
    "- **Programming Language:** Python (or any preferred language).\n",
    "- Share your work via:\n",
    "  - A public GitHub repository.\n",
    "  - Provide the repository link via email.\n",
    "- **Important:**  \n",
    "  - Keep a clear GitHub commit history to show individual contributions, especially if working in pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Presentation**\n",
    "- Presentation details:\n",
    "  - **Duration:** 5 minutes per individual/team.\n",
    "  - **Content:** Discuss:\n",
    "    - Why your strategy works.\n",
    "    - Its effectiveness across different timeframes and markets.\n",
    "  - **Creativity matters:** Out-of-the-box thinking will be rewarded with higher grades.\n",
    "- **Missed Presentations:**  \n",
    "  - If unable to attend the lecture, notify in advance to arrange a Zoom presentation.\n",
    "  - Missing the presentation will incur a **1.0-point grade penalty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Grading Criteria**\n",
    "- Code quality.\n",
    "- Presentation quality.\n",
    "- Idea and research behind the strategy.\n",
    "- Adherence to deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
